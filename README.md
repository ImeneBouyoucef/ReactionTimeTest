# Reaction Time Test ⏱️

A small interactive project built with HTML/CSS/JavaScript + C compiled to WebAssembly, designed to measure a user's reaction time as precisely as possible.

---

## 🔧 Features

- Random delay between 1 and 3 seconds
- Visual signal (green square) to prompt the user to click
- Reaction time calculated in **milliseconds** using a C function (`emscripten_get_now`)
- Simple and responsive interface

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- C (compiled to WebAssembly using Emscripten)
- Live Server (or `python3 -m http.server`) to run locally

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

You must have [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) installed and activated.  
Once it's installed, activate it in your terminal:

source /path/to/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh

Then clone the repository, compile the C file, and start a local server:

git clone https://github.com/ImeneBouyoucef/ReactionTimeTest.git  
cd ReactionTimeTest  
make  
python3 -m http.server 8080

Then open your browser at:  
http://localhost:8080
